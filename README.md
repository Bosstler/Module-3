# Module-3

# Overview

The data set, from the research I conducted, is a rather famous dataset of the passengers aboard the titanic. My friend in the machine-learning class at BYUI introduced me to it.

I also used another dataset he showed me. It is about the types of movies and shows on netflix.

A data scientist I have and am learning the skills to capture, organize, and analyze large amounts of data and look for patterns, trends, and statistical relevance between datasets. I need to understand exactly how the code I write can show me patterns in the data which could be useful as a skill to add to my portfolio.

# Data Analysis Results

How can you create new features in the data?


# Development Environment

I used visual studio code pandas and python were used to complete this project.
